# Github authentication

## gh auth login

Authenticate with a GitHub host

### Synopsis

Authenticate with a GitHub host.

The default authentication mode is a web-based browser flow.

Alternatively, pass in a token on standard input by using --with-token. The minimum required scopes for the token are: "repo", "read:org".

The --scopes flag accepts a comma separated list of scopes you want your gh credentials to have. If absent, this command ensures that gh has access to a minimum set of scopes.
