== Issue (e.g. asciidoctor-rouge)

C:/Users/jadams/.gem/ruby/3.0.0/gems/asciidoctor-rouge-0.4.0/lib/asciidoctor/rouge/treeprocessor.rb:30:in
`initialize': asciidoctor: FAILED: <stdin>: Failed to load AsciiDoc document -
wrong number of arguments (given 1, expected 0) (ArgumentError)

== Background

Because of how much method delegation and metaprogramming this gem uses,
there were a number of issues due to the Ruby 3 keyword argument change.

Most are resolvable by adding ruby2_keywords, but the stuff using
instance_eval is a bit more involved.
