In multiple packages we have a "start" command that launches
webpack-dev-server or ng serve. In the root package.json we have a command
that runs all these start commands

"scripts": {
   "start": "lerna run start --stream"
}

In Lerna v3, when that was running, I could kill it with CTRL+C, and then
launch it again.

In Lerna v4, when I kill the command with CTRL+C, and subsequently launch it
I always now receive EADDRINUSE for the port that the webservers are running
on. As a workaround I use npm package kill-port to kill Lerna's orphaned
child process running on that port, before I can run it again.

As a workaround we have downgraded to Lerna 3.22.1 - this is working as
expected.

Lerna run has a --no-bail flag which would appear to control the behavior
that this is doing, but we do not want the --no-bail behavior but it now
seems to be the default and cannot be disabled.

This seems a broken approach to managing child processes and is a breaking
change for those upgrading to v4.
