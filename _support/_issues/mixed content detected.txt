What is mixed content?
----------------------

Mixed content occurs when initial HTML is loaded over a secure HTTPS
connection, but other resources (such as images, videos, stylesheets, scripts)
are loaded over an insecure HTTP connection. This is called mixed content
because both HTTP and HTTPS content are being loaded to display the same
page, and the initial request was secure over HTTPS.
