Where to load CSS files in a web  page for best performance an do not block page
rendering?

The optimal placement of CSS files in a web page for performance and to avoid
blocking page rendering depends on several factors. Here are the main approaches:

1. External CSS Files:

Placement in the <head> section: This is the most common and recommended
approach. By placing the CSS file link in the <head>, the browser can start
downloading and parsing the CSS as soon as it encounters the link. This allows
the browser to render the page's structure while the CSS is being downloaded.

Placement at the bottom of the <body>: This approach can be considered if
the CSS is not critical for the initial rendering of the page. By placing
the link at the bottom, the browser can render the page's content first and
then apply the CSS styles once the file is downloaded. This can improve
perceived performance, especially on slower connections.

2. Inline CSS:

Embedding CSS directly into the <style> tag: This approach is generally not
recommended for performance reasons, as it can increase the page's initial
load time. However, it can be useful for small amounts of CSS that are specific
to a particular element or section of the page.

3. CSS Modules:

Using CSS Modules to scope CSS rules: This approach can improve performance
by reducing the likelihood of naming conflicts and allowing for more granular
control over CSS styles. CSS Modules can be used in conjunction with bundlers
like Webpack or Parcel.


Additional Considerations
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Minification and Compression:
Minify and compress CSS files to reduce their file size and improve load times.

Browser Caching:
Leverage browser caching to store CSS files locally and avoid unnecessary
downloads.

Critical Rendering Path (CRP):
Optimize the CRP by identifying the CSS rules that are critical for rendering
the above-the-fold content and loading them as early as possible.

Asynchronous Loading:
Consider using asynchronous loading techniques like async or defer attributes
for the <link> tag to prevent the script from blocking the page's rendering.

Ultimately, the best approach for your specific use case will depend on
factors such as the size and complexity of your CSS files, the importance of
CSS for the initial rendering of the page, and your overall performance goals.
