Adding an Embed Video
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Beside the background video, slides support embed videos, too. Each slide
can contain one video that adds a play button over the slide and users
can start playing the video by clicking on the button.

Both embedded videos, like video from YouTube and Vimeo, and self-hosted
video are supported by Master Slider.


Embed video
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To add an embed video to the slide, you need to add the video URL as an
anchor element with ms-slide-video class name. The anchor element should
be a direct child element of the slide.

	<div id="masterslider" class="master-slider">
		<div class="ms-slide">
			<a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dRR_0GzJgU"
        class="ms-slide-video">
      </a>
		</div>
		<!-- .... -->
	</div>

Note: Like the example above, you can set the link to the video page if
the video is from YouTube or Vimeo. For other services you need to use the
embed link address instead.


Self-hosted video
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To add a self-hosted video as a slide video in the markup, you can define it
by HTML video element. Add it as a direct child element of the slide with
ms-slide-video class name.

Then you need to specify the type of video player with data-player-type
attribute of the video element.

Master Slider supports MediaElement.js and Plyr.js and browsers’ native
players to play self-hosted videos. To set the player type for each of the
supported video players, you can use the following values for data-player-type
attribute.

mejs   – Specifies MediaElement.js video player.
plyr   – Specifies Plyr.js video player.
native – Determines the browser’s native video player. This type is not
         recommended since the native video player is not available in all
         browsers.

The following example shows how to add the self-hosted video:

	<div id="masterslider" class="master-slider">
		<div class="ms-slide">
			<video controls class="ms-slide-video" data-player-type="plyr">
      	<source src=".../path/to/video.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
      	<source src=".../path/to/video.ogg" type="video/ogg"/>
      </video>
		</div>
		<!-- .... -->
	</div>

Important: Custom video players like MediaElement.js or Plyr.js are not
included in the slider source. Therefore, their assets are required to be
imported to the page.


Autoplay
--------

You can set slide video to start playing automatically. The video starts
playing after selecting the slide. To enable it, you need to add
data-autplay="true" attribute to the video element.

	<div id="masterslider" class="master-slider">
		<div class="ms-slide">
			<video controls class="ms-slide-video" data-player-type="plyr" data-autoplay="true">
            	<source src=".../path/to/video.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
            	<source src=".../path/to/video.ogg" type="video/ogg"/>
            </video>
		</div>
		<div class="ms-slide">
			<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dRR_0GzJgU" class="ms-slide-video" data-autoplay="true"></a>
		</div>
		<!-- .... -->
	</div>

Note: Autoplay may not work in some mobile devices since some mobile browsers
ignore it.


Go next after video ended
--------------------------

You can set the slider changes to the next slide after the video ends.
To enable this option set data-goto-next="true" attribute to the video
element.
