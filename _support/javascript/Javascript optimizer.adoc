== Does use the JS byte engine use an optimizer before running the code?

Yes, JavaScript engines like V8 (used in Chrome and Node.js) do use
optimizers before running the code. The optimization process typically
happens in two stages:

1. Ignition::
This is a fast interpreter that gets your code running quickly. It
translates your JavaScript code into bytecode, a lower-level representation
that the engine can understand.

2. Turbofan::
This is an optimizing compiler. It analyzes the bytecode and frequently
executed parts of your code. Based on this analysis, it generates faster
machine code that can run directly on your device. This optimization happens
over time, as the engine gathers information about how your code is used.
