  Just use NPM package cross-env. Super easy. Works on Windows, Linux, and
  all environments. Notice that you don't use && to move to the next task.
  You just set the env and then start the next task. Credit to @mikekidder
  or the suggestion in one of the comments here.

  From documentation:

  {
    "scripts": {
      "build": "cross-env NODE_ENV=production OTHERFLAG=myValue webpack --config build/webpack.config.js"
    }
  }

  Notice that if you want to set multiple global vars, you just state them
  in succession, followed by your command to be executed.
