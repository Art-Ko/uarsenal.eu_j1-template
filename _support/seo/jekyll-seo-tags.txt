=== Facebook

See: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10836135/when-do-i-need-a-fbapp-id-or-fbadmins

You can include either of these tags or both, depending on how many people
you want to admin the Insights, etc. A single as fb:admins is pretty much a
minimum requirement. The rest of the Open Graph tags will still be picked
up when people share and like your URL, however it may cause problems in the
future, so please include one of the above.

fb:admins is specified like this:
<meta property="fb:admins" content="USER_ID"/>
OR
<meta property="fb:admins" content="USER_ID,USER_ID2,USER_ID3"/>

and fb:app_id like this:
<meta property="fb:app_id" content="APPID"/>


NOTE:
To use the Like Button and have the Open Graph inspect your website, you need
an application. So you need to associate the Like Button with a 'fb:app_id'.

If you want other users to see the administration page for your website on
Facebook you add fb:admins. So if you are the developer of the application
and the website owner there is no need to add 'fb:admins'.

==== facebook.author

article:author lets a publisher link an article to the Facebook profile of
the author. When the article is shared in News Feed, a "follow" button is
displayed so people can follow the author. The author needs to have Follow
activated on his or her profile for this button to appear.

<meta property="article:author" content="https://www.facebook.com/fareedzakaria" />

==== facebook.publisher

See: https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2013/06/19/platform-updates--new-open-graph-tags-for-media-publishers-and-more/

As mentioned in our https://developers.facebook.com/docs/sharing/best-practices[documentation],
media publishers should include Open Graph tags in their article's HTML to
generate better previews of their content when shared on Facebook. Toda
we're introducing updates to two tags:

`article:publisher` lets a publisher link an article to their own Facebook
page. When the article is shared in News Feed, a "like" button is displayed
so people can like the publisher page.
<meta property="article:publisher" content="https://www.facebook.com/cnn" />

==== facebook.app_id

Including the fb:app_id tag in your HTML HEAD will allow the Facebook scraper
to associate the Open Graph entity for that URL with an application. This
will allow any admins of that app to view Insights about that URL and any
social plugins connected with it.

==== facebook.admins

The fb:admins tag is similar, but allows you to just specify each user ID
that you would like to give the permission to do the above.
