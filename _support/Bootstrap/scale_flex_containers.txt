I'd be glad to help you scale flex containers for width and height on
smartphones using Bootstrap V5. Here's a combined approach that incorporates
the best aspects of both responses and addresses potential issues:

1. Set the Container to Fluid Width:

Wrap your flex container element within a Bootstrap container element.
Use the .container-fluid class to ensure the container spans the entire
viewport width on all devices, including smartphones.

<div class="container-fluid">
  <div class="your-flex-container d-flex">
  </div>
</div>


2. Leverage Flexbox Properties:

* Apply the d-flex class to your flex container element (your-flex-container)
  to activate flexbox layout.

* Use flex-grow: 1 on child elements (flex items) to make them grow
  and fill the available space proportionally within the container.
  This ensures they adapt to the viewport width on smartphones.

<div class="container-fluid">
  <div class="your-flex-container d-flex">
    <div class="flex-item flex-grow-1">Flex Item 1</div>
    <div class="flex-item flex-grow-1">Flex Item 2</div>
    <div class="flex-item flex-grow-1">Flex Item 3</div>
  </div>
</div>


3. Adjust Height as needed (optional):

If you want to control the height of the flex container, you can set a fixed
height or use viewport units like vh. However, be cautious with fixed heights
on mobile layouts, as it might lead to scrolling issues.

Consider using percentages or flexbox properties like align-items: stretch
for content-based height.

<div class="container-fluid">
  <div
    class="your-flex-container d-flex"
    style="height: 200px;">
  </div>
</div>


Key Points:

* .container-fluid is crucial for ensuring the flex container adapts to
  the full viewport width on smartphones.
* flex-grow: 1 on child elements allows them to fill the available space.
* Consider viewport units or content-based methods for height control on
  smartphones.

By combining these techniques, you can create responsive flex containers
that scale effectively on smartphones and other devices using Bootstrap V5.
