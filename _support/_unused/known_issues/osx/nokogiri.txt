Problem:

gem install/compile of nokogiri fails on macOS Mojave (10.14.3) because
of missing/invalid libxml2 libraries.


Solution:

gem install nokogiri -- --use-system-libraries=true --with-xml2-include="$(xcrun --show-sdk-path)"/usr/include/libxml2
--
uilding native extensions with: '--use-system-libraries=true --with-xml2-include=/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX10.14.sdk/usr/include/libxml2'
This could take a while...

brew install libxml2 libxslt pkg-config

libxml2 is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because macOS already provides this software and installing another version in
parallel can cause all kinds of trouble.

If you need to have libxml2 first in your PATH run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/libxml2/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile

For compilers to find libxml2 you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/libxml2/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/libxml2/include"

For pkg-config to find libxml2 you may need to set:
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/libxml2/lib/pkgconfig"

==> libxslt
To allow the nokogiri gem to link against this libxslt run:
  gem install nokogiri -- --with-xslt-dir=/usr/local/opt/libxslt

libxslt is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because macOS already provides this software and installing another version in
parallel can cause all kinds of trouble.

If you need to have libxslt first in your PATH run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/libxslt/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile

For compilers to find libxslt you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/libxslt/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/libxslt/include"

For pkg-config to find libxslt you may need to set:
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/libxslt/lib/pkgconfig"



gem install nokogiri -- --use-system-libraries=true   # --with-xml2-include="$(xcrun --show-sdk-path)"/usr/include/libxml2

I was successful with

gem install nokogiri -- --use-system-libraries=true --with-xml2-include="$(xcrun --show-sdk-path)"/usr/include/libxml2

But not with libxml2 from Homebrew.

This worked for me. Tried almost all the suggestions available on google, stackoverflow, github but failed. This is like life saver for me.
