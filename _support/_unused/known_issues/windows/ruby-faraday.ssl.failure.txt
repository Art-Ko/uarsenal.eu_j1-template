Trying the oAuth flow on a new App @Github and this comes up:

Faraday::SSLError at /auth/github/callback
SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=error: certificate verify failed

So my Chrome browser version 67 seems to like my certificate, no
trouble with HTTPS in the browser for my domain... but in the oAuth
callback the calls choke.

Solution:

Unfortunately browser and Faraday (actually, Net::HTTP) use different
tools to check certificates, so it may be that the latter doesn't like
your certificate or couldn't find the SSL_CERT_FILE (cacert.pem) some
reason.

SSL_CERT_FILE (cacert.pem)
------------
--> Bundle of CA Root Certificates. Provided e.g by OpenSSL.

cacert.pem is a bundle of X.509 certificates of public Certificate
Authorities (CA).

It contains the certificates in PEM format and therefore can be directly
used with e.g. curl|libcurl|php_curl, or with a webserver for SSL
client authentication.

Download: https://github.com/jeroen/openssl/blob/master/inst/cacert.pem

Set environment variables WINDOWS (SYSTEM):



OPENSSL_CONF=C:\J1_QuickStart\openSSL\bin\openssl.cfg
SSL_CERT_FILE=C:\Users\jadams\.ssh\other\cacert.pem
