// https://www.quora.com/Which-is-better-to-create-a-static-site-HTML-or-Jekyll

As soon as more than a few pages are planned for the static site, I recommend
using a static site generator (SSG) like Jekyll instead of writing HTML files
manually. Jekyll supports a configurable layout system based on templates to
generate HTML pages with the same look and feel.

Multiple templates are
available for Jekyll, and many are free to use (open source). For example,
check the theme JekyllOne (J1) at https://jekyll.one/. The J1 Theme uses
Jekyll and the framework Bootstrap to generate a well-known look and feel for
the generated HTML output. The Theme is fully configurable and combines the
best free software for the web. JekyllOne is OpenSource and the modules
included are free to use as well!

Jekyll is a so-called static site generator (SSG). In other words: You can
generate a static website, the HTML pages, with it. Jekyll supports a configurable
layout system based on templates to generate HTML pages with the same look
and feel based on CSS.

For example,
check the theme JekyllOne (J1) at https://jekyll.one/. The J1 Theme uses
Jekyll and the framework Bootstrap to generate a well-known look and feel for
the generated HTML output. The Theme is fully configurable and combines the
best free software for the web. JekyllOne is OpenSource and the modules

=== What are the advantages of using Jekyll to create static pages?
// https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-advantages-of-using-Jekyll-to-create-static-pages

Jekyll is a well-known static site generator (SSG), properly maintained over
the years until now (latest version 4.3.1 of 2022). Using an SSG like Jekyll
means using a simple command line on your local computer to generate a
website's static files (HTML, CSS, etc.). Jekyll does not require any
server-side software (as needed for WordPress) and strips everything down
to the bare minimum, eliminating a lot of complexity.

The advantages of using Jekyll could be summarized as follows:

* simplicity: requires no server maintenance or any updates (like WordPress)
* security: no extraneous libraries, no databases for hackers to attack
* costs: free hosting on GitHub or Netlify

Jekyll is a well-known software supported by an active community. A lot free
addons (plugins) are available to extend Jekyll for additional features.
To create an individual look and feel for the website generated, a huge
number of free themes are available for Jekyll.

It is hard to answer what the most famous static websites are. But it is easy
to point you to famous static websites. I know some sites that are using the
SSG Jekyll to generate and publish their site based on static HTML pages:

* Bitcoin, https://bitcoin.org/, Repo at Github:    https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin
* Docker Docs, https://docs.docker.com/, Repo at Github:   https://github.com/docker/docs

If you want a static website for your project, check the JekyllOne (J1)
theme at https://jekyll.one/. The theme uses Jekyll and the framework
Bootstrap to generate a well-known look and feel for the generated HTML
output. The theme is fully configurable and combines the best free software

The questioon is quite open, but I can point you to some (live) websites
on the Internet using static HTML pages:

* My project JekyllOne at: https://jekyll.one/
* Bitcoin at: https://bitcoin.org/
* Docker Docs at: https://docs.docker.com/

If you like, check Jekyll and the theme JekyllOne (J1) at https://jekyll.one/.
Using the SSG Jekyll, you can generate a full featuted static website. Jekyll
supports a configurable layout system based on templates to generate HTML
pages with the same look and feel based on CSS.

JekyllOne uses the well-known CSS framework Bootstrap. The theme is fully
configurable and combines the best of free software for the web.
JekyllOne is OpenSource and the modules included are free to use as well!


=== What is an Static site generator?
// https://www.quora.com/What-is-an-Static-site-generator

Static website generators (SSGs) are programs that create HTML pages of a
website from text-based template files or already prepared HTML sources.
A SSG represent an alternative to a database-based system (CMS) such as
WordPress. In content management systems, the content of a website is not
managed in simple text files but stored in (relational) databases such as
MySQL.
A typical CMS-driven website works by building each and every page dynamically.
That means fetching the content from a database to pass them over to a template
system (engine) to load the page content, adding the required structure
information (e.g., CSS styles) and Javascript components if needed. This means every page is assembled on demand.
A Static Site Generator takes a different approach and generates all the pages
of the website upfront. That does not necessarily mean that a static website
is always built from scratch. Modern generators support a so-called incremental
build, as does. When there are changes detected to the content, only selected
pages will rebuild.

In the case of blogs, documentation sites, or company websites, CMS and
website builders are used for this, but static site generators have distinct
advantages over a typically much more complex content management solution:

* Speed:: Websites created with a static website generator are
  characterized by excellent user speed. Files are processed when
  the page is created and not when the user views the page.
* Version Control:: Although the content of dynamic web projects
  is stored separately from the code in databases, a static website
  usually resides in simple text files that are fairly easy to maintain.
  Structurally, the content elements do not differ from other parts
  of the code base, so version management is set up without any problems.
* Security:: The advantage of websites built with static website
  builders is that they offer little potential for attack, unlike,
  for example, content management systems like WordPress, which
  are vulnerable to security vulnerabilities and need to be updated
  regularly. The risk potential is limited to the one-off access
  by the customer when accessing the site. Since this is usually
  not about more than the delivery of structured HTML pages,
  the probability of unwanted access is minimal.
* Easy Maintenance:: The number of components required for SSGs is
  comparatively small, but these are only relevant during development.
  While other solutions for live operation require various modules,
  databases, libraries, frameworks, and packages and have to be
  updated regularly, static pages are only tied to a functioning
  web server.

For example, check Jekyll and the theme JekyllOne (J1) at Jekyll One
(https://jekyll.one/). The J1 Theme uses Jekyll and the framework Bootstrap
to generate a well-known look and feel for the generated HTML output. The
Theme is fully configurable and combines the best free software for the web.
JekyllOne is OpenSource and the modules included are free to use as well!

=== How do I create a Jekyll site?

The best answer on this very open question is: learn Jekyll and how to use it.
Nearly an uncountable number of articles around the SSG (static website generator)
Jekyll are available on the Internet.

So what could be a starting point?

My recommendations on this are start at the Makers of Jekyll and read

* the Jekyll 101 at https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/

Continue on my website to create a website in minutes and start learn how to
use Jekyll at:
