== Issue

After upgrading to Ruby 2.7, these warnings are raised:

    warning: Using the last argument as keyword parameters is deprecated

e.g. for  execjs v2.7.0 on Windows.

=== Background

In Ruby 2.7, the way it handles the positional arguments and keyword
arguments is changed, aiming to provide a smooth transition to Ruby 3.

The reason why the Ruby team made the change is because the automatic
conversion "too complex and troublesome". It had caused confusions and
many bug report tickets in the past. So now we as the developers need
to code it explicitly.

Learn more from the official ruby doc: Separation of positional and
keyword arguments in Ruby 3.0:

== Ways to suppress the warnings for Rails

Many gems have been updated to the newly recommended style.

To temporarily suppress the warnings.

1. Start the rails server with RUBYOPT='-W:no-deprecated' rails s
2. Set export RUBYOPT='-W:no-deprecated' in your bash/zsh profile
3. Set Warning[:deprecated] = false in your ruby code

== Set as env var

  export RUBYOPT=""-W:no-deprecated -W:no-experimental"

== Patch version execjs-2.7.0

A new version execjs-2.7.2 is planned but currently NOT available (March 2021).
To fix the issue, a patched version of the file:

  execjs-2.7.0\lib\execjs\external_runtime.rb

is needed.
