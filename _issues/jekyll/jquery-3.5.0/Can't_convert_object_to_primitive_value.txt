This issue seems to be related to jQuery 3.5.0. It is a breaking change
that affects many plugins. Temporarily reverting to a previous versio
of jQuery (like 3.4.1) fixed the issue for me.

At today's answer, jquery already fix the issue and you don't have to do
any regression.

Just uninstall jquery, install it again and the latest 3.5.1 version,
released on 2020-05-04, should fix the problem - for me it did, and I'm
also using Angular 9 and BS4*.
