== Error

  bundle exec jekyll serve fails

== Background

This happens because webrick is no longer a bundled gem in Ruby 3.0.
From https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2020/12/25/ruby-3-0-0-released/:

The following libraries are no longer bundled gems or standard libraries.
Install the corresponding gems to use these features.

sdbm
webrick
net-telnet
xmlrpc

== Solution

Adding gem "webrick" to my Gemfile solves the problem, but Jekyll
should include it in its gemspec.

gem 'webrick', '>=1.7.0'
