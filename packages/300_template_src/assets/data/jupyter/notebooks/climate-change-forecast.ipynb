    "\n",
    "# <font color=green>SARIMA Model (p, d, q)(P, D, Q, S)</font>:\n",
    "SARIMA stands for Seasonal Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average, The name scares, but this is not as scary as it seems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## <font color=green>Non seasonal ARIMA</font>:\n",
    "\n",
    "We can split the Arima term into three terms, AR, I, MA:\n",
    "\n",
    " * **AR(p)** stands for *autoregressive model*, the `p` parameter is an integer that confirms how many lagged series are going to be used to forecast periods ahead, example:\n",
    "     * The average temperature of yesterday has a high correlation with the temperature of today, so we will use AR(1) parameter to forecast future temperatures.\n",
    "     * The formula for the AR(p) model is: $\\hat{y}_{t} = \\mu + \\theta_{1}Y_{t-1} + ... + \\theta_{p}Y_{t-p}$ Where $\\mu$ is the constant term, the **p** is the periods to be used in the regression and $\\theta$ is the parameter fitted to the data.\n",
    "     \n",
    " * **I(d)** is the differencing part, the `d` parameter tells how many differencing orders are going to be used, it tries to make the series stationary, example:\n",
    " \n",
    "     * Yesterday I sold 10 items of a product, today I sold 14, the \"I\" in this case is just the first difference, which is +4, if you are using logarithm base this difference is equivalent to percentual difference. \n",
    "     * If d = 1: $y_{t} = Y_{t} - Y_{t-1}$ where $y_{t}$ is the differenced series and $Y_{t-period}$ is the original series\n",
    "     * If d = 2: $y_{t} = (Y_{t} - Y_{t-1}) - (Y_{t-1} - Y_{t-2}) = Y_{t} - 2Y_{t-1} + Y_{t-2}$\n",
    "     * Note that the second difference is a change-in-change, which is a measure of the local \"acceleration\" rather than trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **MA(q)** stands for *moving average model*, the `q` is the number of lagged forecast errors terms in the prediction equation, example:\n",
    "     * It's strange, but this MA term takes a percentage of the errors between the predicted value against the real. It assumes that the past errors are going to be similar in future events.\n",
    "     * The formula for the MA(p) model is: $\\hat{y}_{t} = \\mu - \\Theta_{1}e_{t-1} + ... + \\Theta_{q}e_{t-q}$ Where $\\mu$ is the constant term, **q** is the period to be used on the $e$ term and $\\Theta$ is the parameter fitted to the errors\n",

    "* **SAR(P)** is the seasonal autoregression of the series.\n",
    "    * The formula for the SAR(P) model is: $\\hat{y}_{t} = \\mu + \\theta_{1}Y_{t-s}$ Where P is quantity of autoregression terms to be added, usually no more than 1 term, **s** is how many periods ago to be used as base and $\\theta$ is the parameter fitted to the data.\n",
    "    * Usually when the subject is weather forecasting, 12 months ago have some information to contribute to the current period.\n",
    "    * Setting P=1 (i.e., SAR(1)) adds a multiple of $Y_{t-s}$ to the forecast for $y_{t}$\n",
    "    \n",
    "* **I(D)** the seasonal difference MUST be used when you have an strong and stable pattern.\n",
    "     * If d = 0 and D = 1: $y_{t} = Y_{t} - Y_{t-s}$ where $y_{t}$ is the differenced series and $Y_{t-s}$ is the original seasonal lag.\n",
    "     * If d =1 and D = 1: $y_{t} = (Y_{t} - Y_{t-1}) - (Y_{t-s} - Y_{t-s-1}) = Y_{t} - Y_{t-1} -Y_{t-s} + Y_{t-s-1}$\n",
    "     * D should never be more than 1, and d+D should never be more than 2. Also, if d+D =2, the constant term should be suppressed.\n",
    "     \n",
    "* **SMA(Q)** \n",
    "     * Setting Q=1 (i.e., SMA(1)) adds a multiple of error $e_{t-s}$ to the forecast for $y_{t}$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **S** It's the seasonal period where you are going to calculate the the P, D, Q terms. If there is a 52 week seasonal correlation this is the number to be used on the 'S' parameter\n",

    "  \n",
    "We will use [SARIMAX](https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/generated/statsmodels.tsa.statespace.sarimax.SARIMAX.html) to create a forecast, the following terms are a definition to the trend:\n",
