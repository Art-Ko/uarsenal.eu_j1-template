[role="dropcap"]
Speak2Me for J1 Template is a speech synthesise module that enables a
so-called screen reader. The reader functionality allows users to sit back
and listen to the browser read aloud the important contents on a Web page.

The *screen reader* on websites created by J1 Template is started by
clicking on the *speaker* symbol mdi:speaker[24px, md-blue] placed top
right in the *menu bar*.

CAUTION: The Speak2Me module is currently only available as an experimental
version, and only elementary elements for designing websites are used for
speech output. In the case of complex elements such as tables, images,
carousels, or galleries, only information texts are generated. Errors in
the speech output can occur, especially with content previously translated
with the build-in translator Google Translate from J1 Template.

The *quality* of the *voice output* depends heavily on the web browser
used. Depending on the browser, different voices are provided for the
outputs, which differ *significantly* in their quality. _Google_'s
browser *Chrome* delivers acceptable results. However, the best results
are provided by _Microsoft_ with the browser *Edge*.

NOTE: Browsers from other manufacturers, such as Firefox, usually use
voices provided by Microsoft free of charge. However, the quality of the
outputs cannot be compared to those offered by Microsoft Edge. Other
Chromium-based browsers, such as the Opera browser, provide voices of a
very poor quality and cannot be recommended for voice output.

== Tables

Tables are used to organize and display data in a structured format. Tables
consist of rows and columns, and they are primarily used to present tabular
data, such as financial data, schedules, comparison charts, and other types
of information that require a grid-like layout.

.Files and Folders
[cols="4a,8a", width="100%", options="header", role="rtable mt-4"]
|===
|File\|Folder |Description

|`_config.yml`
|Stores all *side-wide* used configuration data. Many of these options can
be specified from the command line executable but it's easier to specify
them in a file so you don't have to remember them.

|`_drafts`
|Drafts are unpublished posts. The format of these files is without a
date: `title.MARKUP`.

|===

[role="mt-5"]
== Lists

Lists are used to organize and present information in a structured and
easily readable format. The element is commonly used for creating navigation
menus and content outlines, steps in a process, and various other scenarios
where a structured presentation of information is required.

=== Unordered list

An unordered list represents a collection of items where the order of the
items is not significant. The list elements are typically displayed with
bullet points, or other marker symbols, preceding each item.

An unordered list may look-alike:

* _Windows_, _Linux_ and _MacOS_ platforms supported
* _Jekyll_ v4 Support and _Ruby_ v3 Support
* Asciidoc and Markdown Support

=== Ordered list

An ordered list is a way to present a list of items in a specific order,
where each item is preceded by a sequential number or letter. It's often
used when you want to display information step-by-step or hierarchically.

Here's an example of how an ordered list is displayed:

. _Bootstrap_ extensions included
. _Asciidoctor_ extensions included
. Infinite Scoll Support

=== Definition list

A definition list is a element used to create a list of terms and their
corresponding definitions. It typically present a glossary, a set of
key-value pairs, or any situation where you must associate terms with
their explanations.

[role="mt-4"]
Performance::
*The better performance and a crazy fast load time*.
One of the main advantages of using a static site is the fact that
it is crazy fast to load. Indeed, when the user requests a page, there is
no need to request a database and various files to generate the
page itself as all the content is already placed in a one and only file:
an HTML one.

Security::
*Having a static website: say goodbye to hacking and security issues*.
Are you tired of getting WordPress notifications about security issues and
updates every week? No worries, as a static site has no database, there are
close to no hack possible compared to a WordPress website. Indeed, your
site will have way fewer footprints and security issues since it will
only load plain HTML and CSS files.


[role="mt-5"]
== Text elements

The most common text elements used are *headlines* and *paragraphs*.

Headings typically represent e.g. *titles* and *subtitles* of sections within a
webpage. They provide visual differentiation for your content and play
an important role in accessibility. For example, headings help screen readers
understand the structure of your page and assist in navigation.

A paragraph is a structural element that defines and displays text in a
*text block* as a separate element.

=== Quoted text

Quoted text, usually indicated by enclosing it within quotation marks `" "`,
is used to attribute and reproduce the exact words spoken or written by
someone else.

==== Text examples

Throughout "Becoming," Michelle Obama reflects on her efforts to balance
her personal and professional life, her initiatives as First Lady, and her
advocacy for issues such as education, health, and empowerment.

"Tyrion," came the gruff voice of Ser Jorah Mormont, his greying beard
glimmering with flecks of gold in the fading light. "Your thoughts seem
as stormy as the sea itself. What troubles your mind, my friend?"

"Ah, Ser Jorah," he replied, his voice carrying a trace of both resignation
and determination. "What troubles my mind? Why, the unending dance between
fate and fortune, of course. It seems the gods have deemed me a pawn in
their ever-twisting game. But fear not, my loyal knight, for I shall not be
so easily swept away by the tides of destiny".

=== Structured text

Headlines and paragraphs are commonly used to structure the content of a
web page, making it more readable. See such a structure below that is
typically used in larger text like articles, or books.

==== Chapter One

    Tyrion Lannister stood resolute upon the prow of the majestic vessel,
the Wind's Grace, its timeworn planks creaking beneath his weight.

    His mismatched eyes, one green as the emerald depths of the
Whispering Wood, the other a glimmering pale amethyst, stared out into
the boundless expanse of the Narrow Sea. As the ship cut through the
frothing waves, the wind, bearing the salty tang of the ocean, lashed at
his face, sending raven-black locks of hair spiraling across his brow.

===== Section One

    It was a gusty tempest, much like the swirling turmoil that had
beset his life ever since he had been forced to flee the shores of
Westeros. The crimson light of the setting sun cast an ethereal glow
upon Tyrion's countenance, accentuating the shadows that danced upon his
visage, mirroring the darkness that had shadowed his soul for far too
long.

    His lips, full and pursed in contemplation, were tinged with a touch
of melancholy, the weight of his troubled past etched upon his face like
the lines of a map charting the arduous journey he had undertaken.

    Lost in his ruminations, Tyrion found solace in the rhythmic cadence
of the waves crashing against the ship's hull. Each thunderous collision
reverberated through his being, echoing the tumultuous path he had
traversed.

[role="mt-5"]
== Images

There are two image macro types in AsciiDoc: block and inline. As with all
*Asciidoc macros*, the *block* and *inline* forms differ by the *number*
of *colons* that follow the macro name. The block form uses two colons `::`,
whereas the *inline* form only uses a single one `:`.

=== Inline image

An inline image is displayed in the flow of another element, such as a
paragraph or sidebar block. The inline image macro is almost identical
to the block image macro, except its macro name is followed by a single
colon ':'.

His working life has been defined by questions. *Why is this bastard
lying to me?* was at the front of his mind as he conducted every interview.
But it wasn't just politicians. Paxman's interviews with Dizzee Rascal,
David Bowie, Russell Brand, Vivienne Westwood are legendary. He discussed
belief with religious leaders and philosophers, economics with CEOs and
bankers, books with writers and art and theatre with artists.

After 22 years on University Challenge, Paxman is also the longest-serving
active quizmaster on British television. Now, in these long-awaited memoirs,
he spills the beans behind four decades in front of the camera. He offers
reflections and stories from a career that has taken him as a reporter to
many of the world's war zones and trouble spots - Central America, Beirut,
Belfast, to the studios of Tonight, Panorama, Breakfast Time, the Six O'clock
News. Filled with candid stories about the great, the good and the rotters
that have crossed his path, his memoirs are as magnetic to read as Paxman
is to watch.

Candid, uncompromising, compassionate, reflective and astute, he writes
of the principles that have governed his professional life, the inner
workings of the BBC, the role of journalists in political debate, the
scandals and rows he's been part of, the books he has written and the
series he has made. In a book that tells some terrific stories and laughs
at much of the silliness in the world, A Life in Questions charts the life
of the greatest political interviewer of our time.

[role="mt-4"]
=== Block image

A block image is displayed as a discrete element, i.e., on its own line,
in a document. A block image is designated by image macro name and followed
by two colons `::` It’s preceded by an empty line, entered on a line by
itself, and then followed by an empty line.

== Lightbox

[role="mb-4"]
Find below an example of using the lightbox for standalone images. See how
single (individual) images are linked for use with Lightbox.

.Lightbox block for standalone images
lightbox::example-standalone[ 800, {data-images-standalone}, role="mb-4" ]

[role="mt-5"]
== Carousel

J1 Carousel is based on OWL Carousel V1 in the latest (and unfortunately
last) version of 1.3.3. OWL Carousel is a clean and neat _jQuery_ slider
plugin for creating fully responsive and touch-enabled carousel sliders.

=== Text Carousel

[role="mb-4"]
A slider or carousel is typically used for displaying images. Still, the
implementation for the J1 Template supports a lot more sources to be
displayed as a slide show: simple text, for example.

.Text Carousel
carousel::demo_text_carousel[role="mb-4"]

Important statements or topics can be placed, e.g., on top of an article or
a paragraph, to give them better visibility. In one line, you can present
many facts to know animated for the reader's attention within a single
line. No much space is needed!

=== Parallax Text Carousel

[role="mb-4"]
A more eye-minded type of text-based slide show is a parallax text slider. If
you want to emphasize your statements focussing the meaning, this kind of a
slide show may be interesting. Image-based slide shows may draw off the
reader's attention from the text, therefore a pure text-based presentation
maybe the better choice.

.Parallax Text
carousel::demo_text_carousel_parallax[role="mb-4"]

=== Image Carousel

Carousels are mostly used for pictures data to animate the images as a series.
Find with the following some examples of how to use a carousel for your image
data.

A simple image show is useful, for example, as an animated (or not animated)
banner presenting exciting things about your site or the products offered.

.Image Carousel
carousel::demo_simple[role="mb-4"]


[role="mt-5"]
== Slick Carousel

_Slick_ is a popular jQuery plugin for creating responsive and fully
customizable carousels. It allows developers to easily create beautiful
and dynamic carousels that can display images, videos, or any other type
of content in a visually appealing way. The plugin is designed to be
lightweight, fast, and easy to use, making it a popular choice for all web
developers. It has many features, including multiple navigation options,
lazy loading, or autoplay. Slick carousels are compatible with all modern
browsers and devices, making it a great choice to create a responsive and
mobile-friendly website.

=== Image Carousel

[role="mb-4"]
An _Slick_ image carousel typically consists of a container with images and
a navigation system, including buttons, arrows, or dots that allow users to
move back and forth between images or select a specific image. Image carousels
can also include animation effects, such as fade-in or slide-in transitions
between images, to make the presentation more engaging and visually appealing.

.Carousel + Arrows + Dots + Captions + Lightbox
slick::image_carousel_full[role="mb-5"]

=== Carousel from Collections

[role="mb-4"]
A carousel from a collection for J1 Template is a *pre-defined* carousel
type to display collection *articles* on a webpage as a carousel. Collection
carousels pull content from a specific *collection*. All Carousels
for collections display the article image and a link to the article as a
caption. All Slick carousels for the J1 Template can be easily customized in
various ways, such as changing the slider speed, or the navigation options
like *Arrows* and *Dots*.

.Collection Biography + Arrows + Dots + Gutters
slick::collection_carousel_biography[role="mb-5"]

[#masterSlider]
[role="mt-4"]
== Master Slider

The Javascript tool _Master Slider_ is a 3rd party plugin fully integrated
into the J1 Template by the module `masterslider`. J1 Template uses the
*free* version of Master Slider (MS Lite). The Lite version does *not* support
all features: the functionality of  *filters*, *layouts* are limited and no
*overlay* techniques are supported by the MS Lite version.

[#thumbImages]
=== Slider using ThumbImages

To give the users better control over a slideshow, sliders provide complex UI
elements like *thumbs* placed side-by-side (left|right), at the top, or at
the bottom of a slideshow. Find two examples to control a slideshow by
*thumb images*.

.Slider using ThumbImages
masterslider::ms_00004[role="mb-5"]

[#thumbInfo]
=== Slider using ThumbInfo

To give the users better control over a slideshow, MS Slider provides
complex UI elements like thumbs placed side-by-side (left|right), at the
top, or at the bottom of a slideshow.

.Slider using ThumbInfo
masterslider::ms_00007[role="mb-5"]


[role="mt-5"]
== JustifiedGallery

link:{url-justified-gallery--home}[JustifiedGallery, {browser-window--new}]
is a great _jQuery_ Plugin to create responsive, infinite, and high-quality
justified image galleries. J1 Template combines the Gallery with the lightboxes
supported to enlarge the images of a gallery. See the gallery in action; and
for sure, all that you see is even responsive. Change the size of your current
browser window, by width or height to see what will happen!

.Masonry Grid Gallery
gallery::jg_customizer[role="mb-5"]
