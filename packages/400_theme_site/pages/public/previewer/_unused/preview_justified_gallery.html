      Pictures you've made are typically not even in size. Images may have the
      same size (resolution), but some are orientated landscapes, or others
      may be portraits. For that reason, a more powerful gallery is needed to create
      so-called justified views. JustifiedGallery uses a so-called masonry grid
      layout. It works by placing elements in an optimal position based on available
      horizontal and vertical space. Sort of like mason fitting stones in a wall.
