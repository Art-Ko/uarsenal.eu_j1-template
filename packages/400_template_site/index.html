                                        Jekyll One Template. Gem-based template made for Jekyll.
                                        J1 meets Jekyll and Bootstrap. And makes a lot of friends.
                                        The template system combines the best of free software for
                                        the web.
                                        Jekyll One Template is OpenSource and the modules included
                                        are free to use as well.
