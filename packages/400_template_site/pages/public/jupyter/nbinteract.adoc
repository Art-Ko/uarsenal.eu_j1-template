== Get started with Binder

Binder allows you to create custom computing environments that can be shared
and used by many remote users. You can use many open source languages,
configure the user interface, and more. A Binder service is powered by
BinderHub, an open-source tool that runs on Kubernetes. One such deployment
lives at mybinder.org, and is free to use.

=== BinderHub

BinderHub is a kubernetes-based cloud service that allows users to share
reproducible interactive computing environments from code repositories.
It is the primary technology behind mybinder.org.

=== myBinder

mybinder.org is an online service for building and sharing reproducible and
interactive computational environments from online repositories. Under the
hood, it is a federation of BinderHub deployments that are maintained by the
Binder community. It serves as both a public service and a demonstration of
he BinderHub technology, though it is by no means the only BinderHub in
existence.

=== What is a Binder

A Binder (also called a Binder-ready repository) is a code repository that
contains at least two things:

* Code or content that you’d like people to run. This might be a
  Jupyter Notebook that explains an idea, or an R script that makes a
  visualization.
* Configuration files for your environment. These files are used by Binder
  to build the environment needed to run your code. For a list of all
  configuration files available, see the Configuration Files page.

Configuration files may be placed in the root of your repository or in a
binder/ folder in the repository’s root (i.e. myproject/binder/). A Binder
repository can be built by a BinderHub, which will generate a link that you
can share with others, allowing them to interact with the content in your
repository.

== Example Binder

// See: https://elc.github.io/posts/embed-interactive-notebooks/

=== Binder Repo on Github/Gist

Files in this repository:

* Jupyter notebook (ipynb)
* runtime.txt, specifies used Python version
* requirements.txt, specifies a list of Python packages that should be
  installed (used by Conda))

=== ODEs in Python

// See: https://towardsdatascience.com/ordinal-differential-equation-ode-in-python-8dc1de21323b

Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) can be used to describe a dynamic system.
To some extent, we are living in a dynamic system, the weather outside of the
window changes from dawn to dusk, the metabolism occurs in our body is also a
dynamic system because thousands of reactions and molecules got synthesized
and degraded as time goes.
