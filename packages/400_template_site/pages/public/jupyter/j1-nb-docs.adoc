[NOTE]
====
This is a port for J1 Template of the origial document pages at
https://www.nbinteract.com/[nbinteracts Dos, {browser-window--new}].
Meanwhile, a lot of changes at Binder were done what cause the origial
pages doesn't work anymore. You'll see at the origial documents that all
(interactive) pages never change their state: `Initializing widgets...` and
get stuck in an infinite initializing loop.
====

The package *nbinteract* aims to enable authors and educators to easily create
and share interactive web pages. Interactive explanations of concepts are
useful for communicating and explaining tricky concepts. Consider these
explanations for linear regression and conditional probability, for example.

However, making an interactive webpage often requires significant knowledge
of web technologies and especially Javascript. While Jupyter widgets allow
authors to generate interactive interfaces directly in a Jupyter notebook,
sharing these demos typically requires readers to run the notebook. This
causes issues when the reader's computer lacks (correct versions of) the
packages needed to completely run the notebook.

The package *nbinteract* provides a single binary that converts Jupyter
notebooks into HTML pages. The resulting HTML pages can be shared with
the public, keeping any interactivity created using Jupyter widgets. For
example, the interactive parts of this website are entirely generated from
notebooks using nbinteract.

In addition, nbinteract provides a Python package. Once imported, nbinteract
provides helper methods that allow users to create simple interactive
visualizations with single function calls.

== Getting Started

In the following set of pages, we will show you how to use nbinteract and
its related tools. At the end of this tutorial, you will have a publicly
viewable interactive webpage to share with the world!

=== Following Along

In this tutorial, we assume familiarity with running terminal commands and
using Jupyter notebooks.

The simplest way to follow this tutorial is to use the Binder service to
start a notebook server. On the next page, we'll guide you through the steps
to configure Binder so that the necessary packages are available for use in notebooks.

=== Installing Locally
If you prefer to work on your local machine, you need to install the nbinteract
package. To install the package, run the following commands in your terminal:

[source, sh]
----
pip install nbinteract

# The next two commands can be skipped for notebook version 5.3 and above
jupyter nbextension enable --py --sys-prefix bqplot
jupyter nbextension enable --py --sys-prefix widgetsnbextension
----

== Set Up

To enable interactivity on webpages, nbinteract relies on the free Binder
service. To configure Binder to run your webpages, we will create a GitHub
repository which will also allow you to host your converted webpages publicly.

=== Creating an Account and Repo

To begin, visit https://github.com[Github] and create an account. If you
already have an account, you should log in.

Then, create a new repo. You may do this using the GitHub UI or visiting to
https://github.com/new[create new repo at Github]. Name the repo
nbinteract-tutorial. If you'd like a different name, feel free to name it
something else; just keep in mind that we will use this repo name in later
parts of the tutorial.

Make sure your repo is public, and click the checkbox to initialize your
repo with a README. Your page should look like:

// image gh-repo-setup

Now, click on the Settings link for the repo near the top of the page,
scroll down to the GitHub Pages section, and select the main branch as the
GitHub pages source. Click the Save button to save your changes.

// image gh-pages-setup

Now, any file you upload to this repo will have a public URL. For example,
the README.md file in the repo has the following URL:

  {username}.github.io/nbinteract-tutorial/README.md

Where `{username}` is replaced with your GitHub username. For example,
if my username is SamLau95, my URL is:

  SamLau95.github.io/nbinteract-tutorial/README.md

If you can visit that URL and the page contains text (and not a 404 error)
you've set up your GitHub repo correctly.

=== Cloning Your Repo

Now, visit http://mybinder.org/[Binder] and paste in the URL to your repo.
It should look like:

  https://github.com/{username}/nbinteract-tutorial

Where {username} is replaced with your GitHub username.

Launch the Binder server to open Jupyter. If you are working locally, you
should instead run the following commands in your terminal:

[source, sh]
----
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/{username}/nbinteract-tutorial

# Move into the repo directory
cd nbinteract-tutorial

# Start Jupyter
jupyter notebook
----


== Initializing nbinteract

Via the notebook interface, click on New -> Terminal. This should open a
terminal prompt. Run the following commands:

[source, sh]
----
# Installs nbinteract
pip install nbinteract

# Initializes nbinteract. When prompted, create a requirements.txt file. Since we aren't
# adding additional packages in this tutorial, re-run the command to finish initialization.
nbinteract init

git add -A
git commit -m "Setup nbinteract"
git push origin main
----

This initializes the nbinteract package and pushes the configuration files
to GitHub. If you are working locally, skip the pip install command above
and run the remaining commands in your terminal.
