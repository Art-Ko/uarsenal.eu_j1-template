                                        The package nbinteract aims to enable authors and educators to create and
                                        share interactive web pages easily. Interactive explanations of concepts are
                                        useful for communicating and explaining tricky concepts.

Jupyter Notebook (JN) is an open source web application that allows data
scientists to create and share documents that include live code, equations,
and other multimedia resources.

To understand the technical terms of Jupyter (JN) better, below you find a
brief description the base components.

Web application::
a browser-based tool for interactive authoring of documents which combine
explanatory text, mathematics, computations and their rich media output.

Notebook documents::
a representation of all content visible in the web application, including
inputs and outputs of the computations, explanatory text, mathematics,
images, and rich media representations of objects.

Jupyter Notebook App::

The Jupyter Notebook *App* is a server-client application that allows editing
and running notebook documents via a web browser. The Notebook App can be
executed on a local desktop requiring no internet access or can be installed
on a remote server and accessed through the internet.

Notebook documents::

Notebook documents (or *notebooks* for short) are documents created by the
Notebook App, and both computer code (e.g., Python) and rich text may contain
elements (paragraphs, equations, figures, links, etc.). Notebook documents are
human-readable documents, alongside code descriptions and results like figures,
tables, etc.

== The J1 Module NBI

The Python package `nbinteract` allows authors to convert Jupyter notebooks
into *interactive*, standalone HTML pages: the textbooks. The interactive
elements can use arbitrary Python code to generate output, including Python
libraries that use C extensions (e.g., _NumPy_ and _Pandas_) and libraries
that create images (e.g., _Matplotlib_).

Anyone with a modern web browser can use the resulting web pages even if
the viewer does *not* have Python or Jupyter installed on their computer.
To make this possible, NBI uses the freely available cloud service _Binder_.
Two communication libraries are used to interact with the _BinderHub_ and the
_JupyterHub_ services.

The module nbInteract (NBI) consists of the following components:

* the (modified) JS and CSS files of the library *nbinteract-core* specified
  as resource record `nbinteract` (see: `~/_data/resources.yml`)
* an J1 adapter `nbinteract.js` for integration
* a module configuration `nbinteract.yml`
* an Asciidoc Extension `textbook::` to integrate textbooks (in webpages)

The built-in Starter Web of the template comes with a suitable J1 NBI
configuration and documents for testing. You can find examples of pages that
contain interactive textbooks under the menu `Lern` underneath the submenu
`Experimental|Distributed Notebooks` or `Experimental|Localized Notebooks`.

=== Notebooks vs. Textbooks

Jupyter Notebook documents with the extension `.ipynb` are (data) files in
JSON format and can only be run using the *App* of Jupyter Notebook. On the
other hand, Textbooks are HTML exports with the extension `.html` from
Jupyter Notebooks to be viewed in a web browser.

For integrating textbooks in webpages, the notebooks with the extension
`.ipynb` are to be *exported* to HTML (text) files using the (Python)
program nbinteract. Textbooks that have already been exported can be found
for the *Starter Web* in the folder `~/pages/public/jupyter/notebooks/textbooks`.
